Title Advanced C%Science Programming Techniques
Description This is a course about the practice of programming. Programming is more than just writing code. Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves & others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility, robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications. Students will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their own code and in group projects.
Prerequisites COS 217 and COS 226.

Title Advanced Topics in Modern Architecture: Modernist Dilemmas: Brasilia and Chandigarh turn 50
Description During the twentieth century, several new capitals were built from scratch, for economic and political reasons. Two of these - Brasilia and Chandigarh -- share several traits, partly due to the impact of Le Corbusier. The full force of modern architecture was put to the test. This seminar will reassess these two capitals which are turning 50, studying the original project from different and often conflicting perspectives. Particular attention will be paid to the role of popular and professional media in the global promotion and circulation of the new cities.
