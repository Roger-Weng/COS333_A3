Contributions:
We did mostly pair programming on the assignment. 

Here's the contributions from Yan (Roger) Weng: 
In server.py, I wrote part of the index function, including the template rendering part. 
I also wrote parts of the regdetails function. That includes the requesting cookie part of the code that makes the application stateful to implement the page link back to the primary page. In addition, I also wrote part of the code that gets dept, number, area, and title from the database. In dbconnect.py, I incorporated the escape_special_character function into the file so that the code can be modularized better. 

Here's the contributions from Vishva Ilavelan:
I helped write the code for runserver.py and server.py, as well as the template engine code. 
In runserver.py, I helped configure argparse and helped write the code to run our flask server. 
In server.py, I helped write the logic for handling stateful returns to the get overviews / primary 
page, parse form arguments, as well as handle errors associated with database corruption and 
erroneous classids. I also helped write the HTML templates index.html, regdetails.html, and error.html.
I helped write the logic for implementing the table formatting / general page layout, as well as the clickability
of the classids and other pages. 



Help received: We received help from Professor Dondero on Ed, particularly on
how the words and boxes should be aligned. 

Sources of information: Apart from questions we asked on Ed, 
we looked at lecture slides and handouts while doing the assignment.
We adapted code from lectures and handouts for our general use. 

Specifically, we adapted and referenced the code corresponding to the
Web Programming lecture. Furthermore we utilized / adapted code and referenced 
code and content discussed in Python Server-Side Web Programming One and Two

Time spent on the assignment: 10 hours

Assessment of the assignment:
This assignment was a good review for server-side web programming. It allowed us to better
understand Python Flask framework and Jinja2 template engine. We also learned a lot 
about how to use cookies.

All known bugs: No
