Contributions:
We did mostly pair programming on the assignment. 

Here's the contributions from Yan (Roger) Weng: 
In server.py, I wrote part of the index function, 
In dbconnect.py, I incorporated the escape_special_character function into the file
so that the code can be modularized better. 









Here's the contributions from Vishva Ilavelan:

In reg.py Vishva helped to write the event handling functions that display query data, 
as well as the logic behind the dialog boxes. Furthermore, Vishva also worked on 
developing the nesting for the different frames in reg.py, as well as the client-side 
error handling. In dbconnect.py, Vishva helped alter the functions so that the query 
data structures they returned adhered to the communication protocol. 
In regserver.py, Vishva helped write the socket connection and connection request 
handling code. Vishva also helped write the code for test automation. Finally,
Vishva helped set up the some of the different widgets for the GUI, especially 
the labels and push button




Help received: We received help from Professor Dondero on Ed, particularly for 
error messages and tetsing help

Sources of information: Apart from questions we asked on Ed, 
we looked at lecture slides and handouts while doing the assignment.

We adapted code from lectures and handouts for our general use. 
We used the general structure for database queries and the with statements 
from the slides  and handouts in database programming 1 and 2. We also structured 
our db file, particularly with its functions and URL similar to the code
from lectures 1 and 2.

We adapted code for our approach to developing and managing the GUI. Particularly, 
we adapted code and utilized the associated handouts for GUI programming one
and GUI programming two (particularly coloredisplayer.py), adapting code structure,
particularly for the creation of widgets, event handling, etc. 

Lastly, we also adapted code for the general purpose of creating sockets and
connection. We adapted the general structure of try excepts and with statements,
as well as the broader patterns corresponding to reading and writing data through
a socket. This code from which we adapted corresponds to the Network Programming 1/2
and associated handouts, particularly commgraph2.py

We also referenced the documentation for https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
as well as the documentation for PyQt https://doc.qt.io/qt.html#qtforpython while 
developing our program.

Time spent on the assignment: 15 hours

Assessment of the assignment:
This assignment was a good introduction into server side programming with Python. It also
allowed us to better understand other parts of web programming, particularly HTML, especially
forms. We also were able to learn a lot about template engines while working on the assignment, 
which was rea
All known bugs: No
